## Welcome to PetrArchive 👋

This is an archive of the officially dropped Petr stickers at UCI.

---

### What are Petrs?

Petrs are a tradition at UCI of making and giving out stickers that resemble the UCI mascot Peter. Originally started by Petr the Anteatr, it has grown to a community of many people who donate their time and money to create and distrubute Petr stickers at sticker drops around campus. You can read more about it [here](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8fx7h9r/entire_text/).

### What is this Project?

There are many many Petr stickers. This project is an atempt to catalog Petrs and give a way to "rank" which stickers people like most. You can see the site [here](https://petrarchive.io).

The main website is stored on my github page (its still public) because Im broke and if I host it on an Org then I have to pay for Vercel...

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
